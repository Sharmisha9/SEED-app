# Seed-App
Project Overview

The main goals of this project are to make farmers' lives easier by adding machine learning
models and suggesting crops for greater production. The project is broken into two parts.
1. Simple Search: Attempted to fit a variety of soil types and seasons in this feature, based
on which the farmer can determine which crops to plant and obtain a higher yield. Pesticide
recommendations are also included.
2. Advanced Search: This section includes a Machine Learning model that analyzes an image
and predicts whether or not the plant is healthy. If not, what exactly is the issue? Sensorbased measurements for soil acidity, temperature, and moisture are also incorporated,
resulting in even better predictions for the farmer.
