1,adzuki beans,"Adzuki beans requires loose, well-draining soil, lots of sunshine, and consistent, deep watering. The plants can take between 90 and 120 days to harvest. Beans can be harvested green or when dried.Adzuki Bean grows as an annual vine that requires trellising to support its growth and make the pods easier to harvest.Adzuki beans which are rich in nutrients, such as fiber, protein and manganese are linked to several health benefits, including weight loss, improved digestion and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease"
2,apple,"The best placement for a single tree or a grove of apple trees is in full sun, in well-drained soil, away from other trees and outside of any low-lying area that could form a frost pocket where cold air settles. Good soil drainage is necessary to keep an apple tree's roots healthy, and healthy roots are the foundation of a healthy tree. Light is vital to fruit production and fruit quality, and also helps keep fungal issues from advancing. For your growing success, we do not recommend planting apple trees in rocky or heavy, pure-clay soils. If you can't plant elsewhere, you can try amending the soil of your planting site prior to planting your apple trees. Apple trees can be very adaptable and they respond well to soil additives like compost or fertilizers, so they can get along well even where the soil is nutritionally poor. Eating apples is linked to a lower risk of many chronic conditions, including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer."
3,banana,"Banana trees will grow happily in a wide range of garden soils (sand, clay etc.) but will perform best in a deep, well-drained, organically amended soil as bananas are very hungry and very thirsty plants. Banana trees (even the cold tolerant ones) prefer warm humid temperatures for maximum growth and should be protected from high winds by planting them in a site protected by a wind break such as a building or a hedge. Banana trees need between one to two inches of water weekly and frequent soil checks. The soil must stay evenly moist, so regular watering is required. Plan to use a balanced fertilizer once per month. Organic bananas are rich in potassium, a mineral that plays an important role in heart health."
4,blackgram,"Generally Blackgram is grown in Kharif /rainy and summer season. But, it is best grown in hot and humid conditions with an ideal temperature between 25-35C. The main criteria to decide the time of planting is to tally the maturity crop period with the dry weather for higher yield and good quality seeds. The crop must have a neutral pH and it is best cultivated in Loam or clay loam soil. Alkaline and saline soils should be avoided. Addition of higher organic matter in the soil will help in powerful seed production. The soil must have a good water holding capacity and it should be well drained. Seed treating fungicide should be used to reduce infection which is caused by fungal pathogens in the soil. A regular intake of blackgram prevents formation of kidney stones."
5,cactus,"Cactus  will grow best in lots of light, good drainage, high temperatures and low moisture. cacti plants will do well when positioned in places with good light and not necessarily direct sunlight."
6,chickpea,"A cool-season crop, chickpeas grow best when temperatures hover between 70 and 80 degrees during the day, and stay above 65 degrees at night. The plant thrives in loose soil with good drainage chickpeas can't tolerate waterlogged soil. Chickpea plants aren't fussy about nutrients; soil amended with a bit of natural compost is all they need. Avoid planting chickpeas where green manures have just grown or in soil high in nitrogen; this will result in green leafy growth, not seed production. The fiber, potassium, B vitamins, iron, magnesium, and selenium in chickpeas all support heart health."
7,coconut,"Coconuts subsist in sandy soil or rocky ground that is loamy. Well-draining soil is a must. They can subsist in poor soil, but they won't produce as many delicious coconuts in those conditions. They have a wide pH range for growing, from acidic (5) to slightly alkaline (8). If you're planting a whole coconut palm in a container, give it a good palm soil mix. Coconut trees need pottasium, phosphorus, nitrogen for healthy growth. Coconuts are especially high in manganese, which is essential for bone health and the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and cholesterol."
8,coffee,"Coffee is a tropical plant which is also grown in semi-tropical climate. The coffee tree requires heat, humidity and abundant rainfall. Coffee requires an average temperature between 20-27C.Growth is most rapid during hot rainy season and during cool dry season berries ripen and ready for picking. Bright sunshine and warm weather are necessary for the harvesting. The soil should stay evenly moist but not waterlogged. Never allow the soil to dry out completely. Feed with a weak liquid fertilizer throughout the growing season every couple of weeks. Low to moderate doses of caffeine (50-300 mg) may cause increased alertness, energy, and ability to concentrate."
9,cotton,"Cotton seed germination is favored by high soil oxygen concentration, and adequate moisture. Cotton is a fairly hot weather plant. Never plant so early that the temperature might drop below 60 degrees or so. An average temperature of 90 degrees is good for cotton growth. Part of why cotton takes up so many nutrients from the soil is its extensive root system. In order for the roots to develop enough to obtain those nutrients, lots of moisture is needed, especially early on. Cotton has a tendency to wear out the natural nutrients in soil quickly. In order to maximize your growing conditions, cotton will require plenty of fertilizer."
10,grapes,"Grapes will grow and produce well on a wide range of soil types, but good drainage is very important. Select a location with full sun to allow grapes to fully ripen. Grapes require a minimum of 155 to 160 frost-free growing days to have a bountiful harvest. It is recommended to soil test your preferred site location several weeks prior to planting and apply the appropriate fertilizer amendments grape vines require high potassium levels. The site needs to be weed-free and have a pH of 6.5. Vines grow best in deep, well-drained soils, as most root systems are at least 36 inches deep. Grapes are a good source of potassium, a mineral that helps balance fluids in your body."
11,groundnut,"Groundnut plants need well drained sandy loam or clay loam soil for better performance. The soil should be deep and the pH of the soil should be around 5.5 to 7 with high fertility index. It is observed that heavy soil is unsuitable for cultivation because of difficulty in harvesting and pod loss. The soil should not be saline in nature because these crops are sensitive to salt. The soil for groundnut farming should not have stones and clay otherwise the yield would be affected. The temperature of the area should be around 27-30?C for good germination and growth. The minimum annual rainfall required for the crops is in between 450 to 1250 mm. High altitudes, cold and frost are not suitable for groundnut farming. Exclusively long warm climate is good for cultivating groundnuts. Groundnuts are a great blend of healthy fats, protein and fibre that curbs your appetite, lowers the risk of heart disease and regulates blood glucose levels."
12,jute,"Jute is essentially a tropical plant and requires high temperature and high precipitation. It needs a well-distributed rainfall throughout with light showers and ample sunshine in the early stages. Jute, like other fibers, requires rich soils and thrives on river alluvium, especially where annual floods renew the fertility of the soil. The best quality of jute is obtained from loamy soils, whereas the heaviest yield comes from clayey soils. The plant grows rapidly and is harvested after about 3-4 months."
13,kidneybeans,"Beans grow best in slightly acidic to neutral soil, pH between 6 and 7. Clay or silt loams are better for bean production than sandy soils, although good drainage is important. Use well-rotted manure or compost at planting to increase soil organic matter. In addition to nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, beans also need small amounts of calcium, manganese and iron for a healthy beans. Kidney beans help build muscle mass, strengthen the bones, and regulate your blood sugar levels"
14,lentil,"Overall, lentils adapt to all soil types but the key is good drainage. Plants prefer sandy loam soils that are well-drained and fertile. Upon planting, water well without flooding. If weather conditions become especially dry, know that lentil plants are drought tolerant and may even die if the soil becomes waterlogged. Stop watering when pods begin to dry.If your soil is naturally clumpy, add compost to loosen it. Lentils are rich in fibre, folate and potassium making them a great choice for the heart and for managing blood pressure and cholesterol."
15,maize,"Maize can be grown in all types of soil. But for good growth and productivity of maize, loam and medium to heavy soil having adequate amount of bacteria and proper drainage is suitable. Saline and alkaline soil are not suitable for maize cultivation. Maize plants are very heavy feeders and even the most fertile of soils may need to supplemented with nutrients as the plants develop, particularly nitrogen. Maize also requires plenty of space as it grows and is pollinated by wind. It should be planted where it will receive full sunlight for most of the day and provided with ample moisture.  Corn is rich in vitamin C, an antioxidant that helps protect your cells from damage."
16,mango,"Mangoes will grow in almost any well-drained soil whether sandy, loam or clay, with a pH between 5.5 and 7.5. Avoid heavy, wet soils. They have an extensive root system so like deep soil. A mango tree requires full sun. Mango trees grow best when watered using a wet/dry cycle. This means irrigating until the soil is fully saturated, then waiting until the soil is relatively dry before watering again. Mangos do not tolerate constantly wet conditions, so allowing the soil to dry down will keep the mango tree healthy. Young trees require nitrogen, but they are sensitive to excessive nitrogen and are prone to burning. Apply a balanced fertilizer in the spring, summer, and fall during the first few years until the mango tree becomes established."
17,millet,"Millet does best in well-draining warm sandy or loamy soils. Being very drought-tolerant, millet does not need a lot of water. Millet is often grown in less fertile soil, so fertilizing is optional. If you do want to fertilize millet, focusing on products with a high amount of nitrogen. Higher temperatures result in faster growth and taller plants. As long as the soil is kept evenly moist, high humidity is not required.  Millet is rich in niacin, which helps your body manage more than 400 enzyme reactions."
18,mothbeans,"The moth bean is drought-resistant, the plants can be grown on many soil types. Generally very little irrigation is required for growing moth bean plants. Moth Bean is adapted to dry soils because of its well-developed taproot and its thick growth, which shades out weeds and retains soil moisture. It can tolerate very little rainfall, as little as 500 mm or less if it comes in 3 - 4 different showers during its growing season. The moth bean plants don't require applying additional fertilizer. Sprouted moth bean are a rich source of calcium and dietary fibre which play a prominent role in building stronger muscles."
19,mungbean,"Mung beans do best on fertile, sandy loam soils with good internal drain- age and a pH in the range of 6.3 and 7.2. Mung beans require slightly acid soil for best growth. If they are grown in rotation, lime to attain pH of the most acid sensitive crop. Root growth can be restricted on heavy clays. . As a nitrogen fixer, mungo beans are self-fertilizing once established. However, if your soil is extremely poor, you can use a low nitrogen fertilizer."
20,muskmelon,"Muskmelons are a warm season crop, adapted to average monthly temperatures of 65 to 75 degrees F, and needing ample soil moisture and nutrients for growth. During the ripening period the best quality melons are produced when hot, dry conditions prevail. Do not let your melon plants get dried out during the growing season. They are not tolerant of drought. Additionally, be cautious not to over-water plants as this can negatively impact the taste and flavor later on. Keep soil moist but not soggy. Muskmelon requires continuous supply of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium fertilizers during its growth period. Muskmelon is high in water content, which keeps your body hydrated in the hot summer season"
21,orange,"Orange trees require plenty of sunshine and warmth to produce the best tasting fruits, so choose a spot that receives full sun for 8 hours a day. Orange trees thrive in loamy, rich, well-draining soil. It is important that excess water drains away, as orange trees cannot tolerate heavy, wet soil. When planting these trees, you can mix in potting soil for additional nutrients. Slightly acidic to neutral soil pH levels from 6.0 to 7.0 work best. Orange trees need consistent watering but don't tolerate soggy soil. When grown in cooler areas, orange trees need fertilizer every month or two during the growing season. In warmer zones, such as 10 and 11, fertilizing year round encourages continual growth and fruit production. The fiber in oranges can keep blood sugar levels in check and reduce high cholesterol to prevent cardiovascular disease."
22,papaya,"To successfully grow Papayas, you need a frost free climate, lots of sunlight, lots of water and good soil. If you give your plant all of these conditions, then you can grow a papaya from seed and generally have fruit in 6 to 12 months. These plants need a prodigious amount of water. As the plant grows, expect to water it every three to four days. You want to water it thoroughly but never let water stand on top of the soil. Feed your papaya plant abundantly. Papayas are very rapidly growing plants that need nutrients to support that growth. Feed it every few weeks with a balanced fertilizer. The possible health benefits of consuming papaya include a reduced risk of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, aiding in digestion."
23,peas,"Peas are very easy to grow but their growing period is very limited. Select a sunny location and well-draining soil. Although peas can grow in part shade, they won't be as sweet or productive as those grown in full sun. Prepare the soil, preferable in the fall, mixing in aged manure and/or compost, and much well. Peas like well-draining soil. Fertilizer typically isn't required for pea plants. But, it's helpful to mix some compost into the soil prior to planting, especially if you don't have nutrient-rich soil. Peas are a good source of vitamins C and E, zinc, and other antioxidants that strengthen your immune system."
24,pigeonpeas,"Pigeon peas aren't picky about soil. They do best in soil with a pH ranging from 5.0 to 7.0, but they can also produce an edible crop in far more alkaline soil, with a pH up to 8.0. They also grow readily in clay, loam, or sand. But they still grow better if you cultivate the soil down a few inches ahead of sowing. Pigeon peas are tough little plants that will grow through drought, poor soil, and lots of heat. Too much nutrition can lead to an overabundance of foliage over beans, and the plants don't really need supplemental fertilizer to thrive. The first few weeks after the seeds sprout are important. Be sure to keep the soil moist, but not wet, and the area free of weeds. Pigeon peas contain dietary fiber, potassium and helps to lower the cholesterol levels which helps to maintain cardiovascular health."
25,pomegranate,"Pomegranates grow in locations with tropical or warm and temperate climates. They will grow best, though, in locales with hot, dry summers and cool winters.Pomegranate trees will grow best in a well-draining soil, Alkaline soils can limit and restrict growth. Pomegranates require full sun to grow and thrive. You should plant the tree in the sunniest and warmest place of your yard if possible. As your new tree reaches maturity, consider amending the soil with compost instead of fertilizing it. Benefits of pomegranate juice include being an antioxidant, which may help prevent cancer."
26,rice,"Rice crop needs a hot and humid climate. It is best suited to regions which have high humidity, prolonged sunshine and an assured supply of water. Rice consumes about 4,000 - 5,000 litres of water per kg of grain produced. But it is no aquatic crop: it has great ability to tolerate submergence. Water creates unfavourable conditions for weeds, by cutting off sunlight and aeration to the ground. Paddy requires three essential plant nutrients: nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Most paddy lands have a moderate quantity of such nutrients, but if they are deficient, organic manure or artificial fertilizers have to be used."
27,rubber,"Rubber is a tropical tree. It requires high temperature throughout the year ranging between 20-35C or average monthly mean of 27C. Less than 20C temperature is detrimental. Similarly, rubber also requires heavy rainfall. Deep, friable, well-drained soils are ideal as they promote root development, and acidic soils are also suitable. Keep a close eye on the moisture level of your rubber tree's soil. It should be moist at all times, but too much or too little water can cause issues. For your plant to thrive, the soil must be kept evenly moist at all times not too wet and not too dry"
28,sugarcane,"Plant sugar cane in well-drained, nutrient rich soil. Excess nitrogen causes significant cane growth but lowers the sugar content of the plant. Sugar cane requires regular moisture but does not perform well if it becomes overly wet or remains waterlogged for periods of time. Take care to keep the soil moist but not wet, especially immediately after planting and until the sugar cane shoots break above the ground. Sugar cane grows well in full sun, partial shade results in reduced overall growth. Sugarcane relies heavily on nitrogen and phosphorus. Sugar cane can be burned by too much fertilizer, so avoid overdoing it."
29,tea,"Temperature plays a critical part in the growth, yield and quality of tea. Tea requires cool to warm temperatures with at least 5 hours of sunlight per day. The mean annual temperature during the growing season is between 18 and 21. Tea needs heavy rainfall in the form of frequent showers, without extended freezing periods in the winter.  Most commercially-managed tea operations are located on hill slopes in the highlands where drainage is good. High humidity, morning fog, and heavy dew favor the growth of buds and young leaves"
30,tobacco,"Tobacco should be grown in a sunny location on well-drained soils. Poorly drained soils could result in poor growth and even death of the plants. Tobacco can be grown on poorly-drained soils if the rows or hills are bedded and ditches or furrows are used to remove excess water. Drought stress could limit growth on excessively drained soils unless irrigation is provided. Lack of sun will result in spindly plants, poor growth and thin leaves. Avoid planting tobacco on soil infested with nematodes and diseases. Grasses would be excellent rotations for tobacco, while tomato, pepper, and similar plants would not be suitable. As in plant production, the fertilizer should contain little or no chlorine and most of the nitrogen should be in the nitrate form."
31,watermelon,"Watermelons do best in loamy, somewhat-sandy, well-drained soil. They can struggle in soil that contains too much clay and doesn't drain well. Watermelons need A LOT of space-up to 20 square feet per plant. Their vines need room to sprawl, so plant them in a place where they won't crowd out other crops. Growing the vines in raised rows, known as hills, ensures good drainage and will hold the sun's heat longer. Watering is very important from planting until fruit begins to form. If you choose to fertilize, make sure it delivers more nitrogen than phosphorus and potassium, as this will encourage leaf and vine growth. Watermelon is rich in an amino acid called citrulline that may help move blood through your body and can lower your blood pressure."
32,wheat,"Wheat thrives in full sun conditions, and you will need at least six hours of direct sunlight per day to produce a thriving wheat crop. A well-drained loamy soil is best for wheat; poor drainage can lead to problems from excessive moisture. Drip irrigation is a useful method for watering wheat and keeping excessive moisture from the tops of plants, getting water to the roots where it is most needed. Heavy rains or long periods of high humidity can affect wheat's growth. If your summers tend to have long periods of humid weather you can try planting wheat in a higher location or one more exposed to wind, which can tend to help the plants stay drier. Fertilizer isn't necessary for wheat during its growing cycle and may even stunt the plants' growth. But enriching the soil before planting is a good idea. The powerful health benefits of wheat may include its ability to control obesity, boost energy, inhibit type 2 diabetes, improve metabolism."
